                    ‚ÄúI was an EMT for many years before I
                    joined the bootcamp.
                    I‚Äôve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience
                    here. I
                    signed up
                    for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                    weeks
                    was the best
                    - and most grueling
                    - time of my life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a
                    Software Engineer
                    at a VR startup."</p>

                    Before joining the
                    bootcamp, I‚Äôve never
                    written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming
                    step by
                    step. I
                    was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                    program. The
                    entire curriculum
                    and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                    The agile
                    team
                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                    tutorial could
                    ever
                    have. In fact, I‚Äôve
                    often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
                    helped me land a
                    job
                    as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
